- 👋 Hi, I’m @analaura-bot
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and programming/coding. I started to learn how to code recently and to be honest, I think I've finally found something that I REALLY enjoy doing it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics on computer science. I'm taking the CS50x (an introduction to Computer Science) Harvard course now, giving babysteps to the world of coding!
- 💞️ Since I'm a beginner, I don't think there's a lot I can collaborate now, but I promise this will change!
- 📫 You can reach me at my email, analauratc23@gmail.com. Let's be friends!
